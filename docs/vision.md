# Background & Context

Labor market dynamics is probably as fundamental concern for all of us much like eating, sleeping and other needs in life. Understanding labor market has significant implications in the areas of for e.g.

- Matching supply and demand of labor
- Identify supply and demand of  labor skills by geo location
- Readiness index “before” venturing into a new geo location - to ensure there is capacity to scale  

The roles involved in the labor market

- Employer/Company (who hires labor)
- People (the actual labor)
- Government (from governance and overall watchdog - ensuring fairness)

# Problem Statement

Few questions, answers to which have significant implications in labor market

    How much salary can I ask for the job ? - Job Seeker

    How much salary do I pay for the job ? - Employer 

    What is a “fair” salary for a job in the labor market ? - Government

The answer to each of the above questions “depends” on too many variables that move daily in the labor market (some affected by macro-economic movements like stock market, technology, GDP and others micro-economic like “scope”, negotiation, public vs. private sector etc.)

    Like KBB (Kelly blue book) index for car prices in the US (free for certain high-level data and paid for granular data) - Is it possible to track labor metrics (by geo, by wage, by ..etc.)
